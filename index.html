        <h1>Look, let's be honest.</h1>
        <p>Things <em>had</em> to happen this way.</p>
        <h3>I know what you're thinking...</h3>
        <!-- Yesss... comment! -->
        <p>And let me just say - no, <strong>it's not true!</strong></p>
        <p>Argh... look, here are the main points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have to shit.</li>
            <li>You have to fart.</li>
            <li>You have to have a good time.</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            (Google it if you don't believe me.)
        </a>
        <p>This might be confusing... <em>but it is possible.</em>
        Here's what you have to do:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Run outside.</li>
            <li>Stab the first person you see.</li>
            <li>Discard the weapon.</li>
            <li>Turn yourself in to the police.</li>
            <li>After being held in custody for at least 2 hours, demand
                that you be released, claiming that you didn't do anything.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please, believe me when I say this:</p>
        <h2>This is the ONLY way to get into heaven!</h2>
        <p>Look, if you don't believe me, <a href="the-other-page.html">
            just visit the other page.
